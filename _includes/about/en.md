Hey， I am an inverse entropy person（ github@entropy-reverser ）Focusing on the intersection of computer science and technology and computer vision design, I studied at Changchun University of Technology's Department of Art and Computer Science for my undergraduate degree, and plan to further explore computer vision and graphics for graduate studies in the future.
Thorough and comprehensive thinking, patience is one's strong capital, and the principle that has always been followed is to start from the essence of everything, start with the simplest ideas, and not overthink. As of the second semester of my junior year in 2024, my academic experience is as follows: pursuing professional courses in the field of advertising, including marketing, brand strategy, etc; Studying computer vision design, including color composition, graphic creativity, The application of graphics processing tools such as PSAIID, The application of video processing tools such as AE and PR, as well as the application of 3D design and 3D creation tools, with experience in participating in future designers and the Guangzhou competition, and maintaining a GPA of around 3.5 in professional courses; At the same time, I entered the university science and technology industry incubation zone studio as a project assistant, assisting in daily affairs processing and being proficient in using document data tools such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint; To achieve a proficiency level of CET-6 in English; Then, starting from the second semester of my sophomore year, I started my preliminary studies in computer science, including program design, data structures, and algorithms. I also practiced daily algorithms in Leedcode, built a local personal blog demo project using the VuePress framework, and deployed my personal blog project on GitHub.
I am currently further studying Excel and also learning how to use the AI drawing tool Stable Diffusion, AIGC is in my field of interest and I am planning to find an internship to expand my experience. My personal email is: 3232615580@qq.com Contact number: 17519486073
